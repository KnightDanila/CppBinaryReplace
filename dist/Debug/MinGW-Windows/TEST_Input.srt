<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,643
( screeches )

3
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,919
Ygritte:
How far are we?

4
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:13,121
About a week, I think.

5
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:15,690
You think?
You don't know?

6
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:19,393
Jon: When we went to Castle
Black, we took the kingsroad.

7
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:22,128
( scoffs ) You and your roads.

8
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,630
Is that how you lot
do your fighting?

9
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:28,066
You march down the road banging
drums and waving banners?

10
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,734
Most of the time, yes.

11
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,438
How do the men holding
the banners fight?

12
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,440
They don't, really.

13
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:39,511
It's a great honor
to carry your house sigil.

14
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,614
And the drummers-- is
that a great honor, too?

15
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:45,650
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

16
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:47,319
So what good are they?

17
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:50,756
- They help the men march.
- How?

18
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,360
Well, it's--
it's the rhythm.

19
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,896
Oh, you mean right foot,
left foot,

20
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,931
right foot,
left foot, right foot?

21
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:02,135
You need help remembering that?

22
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:05,405
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

23
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,909
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

24
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:11,011
No.

25
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:14,314
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

26
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:17,784
the North has ever seen to
let them know you're coming.

27
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:20,420
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

28
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,324
Orell:
She's right, you don't.

29
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:30,629
I know you cut me
loose on the Wall.

30
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:32,397
Cut her loose, too.

31
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:34,465
Do you see her
sulking about it?

32
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,569
That's because she understands
the way things are.

33
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:43,174
And are you gonna
share it with me?

34
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,544
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

35
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:48,946
People work together
when it suits them.

36
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,648
They're loyal
when it suits them.

37
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:53,184
They love each other
when it suits them.

38
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,087
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

39
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:58,257
She knows that, you don't.

40
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,694
Which is why you'll
never hold onto her.

41
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:17,109
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

42
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:20,179
That rain will cost us
another day.

43
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:24,584
Frey will wait.
He knows we're coming.

44
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,786
Lord Walder is prickly
by nature.

45
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,188
Prickly?
That what you call it?

46
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:31,557
Might be the least
pleasant man I've ever met.

47
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:34,226
- Yes, and that is why--
- I've seen wet shits

48
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:37,429
<i>I liked better</i>
<i>than Walder Frey.</i>

49
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:41,966
Apologies, Your Grace.

50
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,069
Spent too many years around
lancers and pikemen.

51
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,905
I've spent the last two
years nursing wounded men,

52
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,107
watching them bleed and die.

53
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,176
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

54
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,945
( laughs )

55
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,447
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

56
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:58,149
He can take it as he likes.

57
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:00,285
He's getting
the wedding he wanted.

58
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,953
He's getting a wedding.

59
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:04,289
It was a king he wanted.

60
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:06,325
Robb: <i>Edmure is the best
match a Frey has had</i>

61
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,228
in the history of their house.

62
00:05:09,262 --> 00:05:10,996
We should all get some sleep.

63
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:30,749
<i>( heavy breathing )</i>

64
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,677
If you don't put
some clothes on,

65
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,213
I can't promise
I won't attack you again.

66
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,448
Attack. Attack.

67
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:00,407
<i>Who are you writing?</i>

68
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,843
My mother.

69
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:07,414
- Is that Valyrian?
- Gaaa.

70
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,249
Gaaa?

71
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:15,122
( sighs )

72
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,192
Say hello for me.

73
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:20,561
<i>Rytsas.</i>

74
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:23,798
- <i>"Ritsas."</i>
- ( laughs )

75
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:25,833
That was close enough.

76
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,506
Does she know
her daughter's a queen?

77
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,642
Not yet.

78
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:37,980
That will be
a surprise, I expect.

79
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:42,618
Many surprises for her.

80
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:49,292
How am I supposed
to sit here planning a war

81
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,628
when you're over there
looking like that?

82
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:58,835
Will you come with me
one day to Volantis?

83
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,438
<i>When all this is over?</i>

84
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:03,707
I will.

85
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,110
I promise.

86
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:13,818
<i>I know she'd love to meet you.</i>

87
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,954
And her grandchild.

88
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,760
What, now?

89
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,834
Are you certain?

90
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:34,005
Are you angry with me?

91
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,807
Angry?

92
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,212
You're my queen.

93
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:47,752
And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.

94
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:51,289
Maybe one of each.

95
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,324
Don't get greedy.

96
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,392
( laughing )

97
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:05,569
Can you leave the war
for one night?

98
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,974
I love you.

99
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:13,879
Do you hear me?

100
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:16,415
I love you.

101
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:24,957
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

102
00:09:30,497 --> 00:09:33,499
Tormund:
Most men fuck like dogs.

103

( grunting )

104
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:38,136
No grace, no skill.

105
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:40,205
A few dozen thrusts and done.

106
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:43,341
You need to be patient.
Give her time.

107
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,643
Your cock shouldn't go near her

108
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,979
till she's slick
as a baby seal.

109
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,748
And then you go inside,

110
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:53,417
<i>but slowly.</i>

111
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:56,887
Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.

112
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,489
( laughs )
Come on!

113
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:01,959
( laughs )
Hey, come on.

114
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:16,273
Orell: You think he
loves you, is that it?

115
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:19,143
What did he tell you? He's
gonna make you his lady

116
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:21,646
and live with you
in some castle?

117
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,315
No, he didn't tell me anything.

118
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,084
He barely talks.

119
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:28,320
I've seen you two
whispering in the night,

120
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,522
giggling like a pair of girls.

121
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:32,423
What, you're jealous?

122
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,359
Of course I'm jealous.

123
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:36,227
You should be
with one of your own.

124
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,062
And you're one of my own?

125
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,856
I've never heard
a kind word from your mouth.

126
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:43,066
You would if you were mine.

127
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,770
I'd tell you
that you're beautiful

128
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:51,141
and fierce and wild.

129
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:53,309
I'd be good to you.

130
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,247
You love him?

131
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:07,422
'Cause he's pretty?
Is that it?

132
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:10,559
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

133
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:15,197
- You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
- Don't touch me.

134
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:18,434
You won't love him so much when
you find out what he really is.

135
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:25,574
Growing up at Winterfell, all
I ever wanted was to escape,

136
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:29,745
to come here to the capital.

137
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,414
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

138
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:35,918
and King's Landing
after dark--

139
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,456
all the candles burning
in all those windows.

140
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:44,626
I'm stupid.

141
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,129
A stupid little girl

142
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:50,132
with stupid dreams
who never learns.

143
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,100
Come on.

144
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:56,004
Come walk with me.

145
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,708
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

146
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:04,011
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

147
00:12:04,046 --> 00:12:06,480
I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,

148
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:08,649
and so does my grandmother.

149
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:13,687
You would have been
happy at Highgarden.

150
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,255
But women in our position

151
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,292
must make the best
of our circumstances.

152
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:21,329
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

153
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:23,631
I have to marry him.

154
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:28,670
- Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
- No.

155
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:31,206
Has he been kind to you?

156
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,508
He's tried.

157
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,009
You don't want him, though.

158
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:36,344
He's a Lannister.

159
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:38,980
Far from the worst
Lannister, wouldn't you say?

160
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,217
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:45,086
Here I am complaining to you...

162
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,689
My son will be king.

163
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,191
Sons learn from their mothers.

164
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:52,126
I plan to teach mine
a great deal.

165
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:54,963
And your son,
if I'm not mistaken,

166
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:58,934
your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock

167
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:00,836
and the North someday.

168
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,140
What?

169
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,642
My son...

170
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,777
with him.

171
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,549
I'll have to--

172
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,518
we'll have to--

173
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,487
If it's the pain
you're worried about--

174
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,722
I'm not afraid of the pain.

175
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,858
Not after what
Joffrey's done to me.

176
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:24,493
What is it, then?

177
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:29,031
He's rather good-looking
even with the scar.

178
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:31,267
Especially with the scar.

179
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:33,702
He's a dwarf.

180
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:35,938
And Loras--

181
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:37,740
Loras.

182
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:42,979
Some women like tall men.

183
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:44,648
Some like short men.

184
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:47,451
Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.

185
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:50,687
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men,

186
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:53,090
pretty girls.

187
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,193
Most women don't know what they
like until they've tried it.

188
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:59,863
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little

189
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:02,165
before we're old and gray.

190
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,235
Tyrion may surprise you.

191
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,972
From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.

192
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:12,242
And that's a good thing?

193
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:13,677
<i>It can be.</i>

194
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:15,479
We're very complicated,
you know.

195
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,848
Pleasing us takes practice.

196
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:20,284
How do you know all this?

197
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,719
Did your mother teach you?

198
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:28,758
Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.

199
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,265
Tyrion:
<i>She's a child.</i>

200
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,833
Bronn: <i>She's a foot
taller than you.</i>

201
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,668
A tall child.

202
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,737
What's the youngest
you've ever had?

203
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:41,272
Not that young.

204
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:43,541
How much older?

205
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:45,310
Older.

206
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,447
You're a lord, she's a lady.

207
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,315
And a beauty at that.

208
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,883
I don't see the problem.

209
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:54,186
Shae isn't going to like it.

210
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,954
Shae is a whore.

211
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:58,591
Are you gonna
marry her? Eh?

212
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,694
How did marrying a whore work
out for you the first time?

213
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:04,664
I should never have
told you about that.

214
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:08,067
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

215
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:11,271
All you have to do is get
a son in the Stark girl.

216
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,173
He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.

217
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,408
You can rule the North
in his name.

218
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,211
You'll have two women and a
whole kingdom of your own.

219
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,080
Two women to despise me

220
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:22,415
and a whole kingdom
to join them.

221
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:27,253
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

222
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:30,056
you'll end up the most
popular dead man in town.

223
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,159
<i>( chuckling )</i>

224
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,163
You want to fuck
that Stark girl.

225
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:38,798
<i>You just don't want</i>
<i>to admit it.</i>

226
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,736
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

227
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,606
The ones already there
don't need company.

228
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,208
You pay me to kill people
who bother you.

229
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:53,113
Evil notions come free.

230
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:19,805
<i>( doors close )</i>

231
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:27,179
Your Grace.

232
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,315
Grandfather.

233
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:31,651
You wanted to speak to me?

234
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:33,452
Yes.

235
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:37,490
I'd like a report on the
meetings of my small council.

236
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:39,593
You're welcome
to attend the meetings

237
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:41,829
of your small council,
Your Grace.

238
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,331
Any or all of them.

239
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,200
I've been very busy.

240
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,836
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

241
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,038
Of course.

242
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:53,608
You've been holding
the council meetings

243
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:57,211
in the Tower of the Hand instead
of the small council chamber.

244
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:58,913
I have, yes.

245
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:01,950
May I ask why?

246
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:04,986
The Tower of the Hand
is where I work.

247
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:08,189
To walk from there
to here would take time,

248
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:10,892
time I could otherwise
spend productively.

249
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:13,294
So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,

250
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,198
I would now have to climb all the
stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

251
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:35,517
We could arrange
to have you carried.

252
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:40,822
Tell me about
the Targaryen girl

253
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,891
in the east and her dragons.

254
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:45,560
Where did you hear about this?

255
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:48,062
Is it true?

256
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:50,164
Apparently so.

257
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:56,436
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

258
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:59,172
When I was Hand of the King

259
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,441
under your father's
predecessor,

260
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:04,077
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons

261
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:06,545
were kept in this room.

262
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:10,315
The skull of the last of them

263
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,384
was right here.

264
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:15,854
It was the size of an apple.

265
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,858
And the biggest
was the size of a carriage.

266
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:22,661
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged

267
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:25,864
died 300 years ago.

268
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:28,500
Curiosities on the far
side of the world

269
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:29,868
are no threat to us.

270
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:33,305
But how do we know these
dragons are just curiosities

271
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,375
and not the beasts that brought
the whole world to heel?

272
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:39,378
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

273
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:41,547
who serve the realm
by counseling the king

274
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,515
on matters about
which he knows nothing.

275
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,984
But I haven't been counseled.

276
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,688
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

277
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:54,927
I should be consulted
about such things.

278
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,462
From now on, I will see to it

279
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:58,564
that you are
appropriately consulted

280
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:00,866
on important matters

281
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,002
whenever necessary.

282
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:10,509
Your Grace.

283
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:25,556
Yunkai.

284
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,657
The Yellow City.

285
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:34,764
Barristan: <i>The Yunkish train
bed slaves, not soldiers.</i>

286
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,833
We can defeat them.

287
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:39,302
On the field, with ease.

288
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,071
But they won't
meet us on the field.

289
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:44,274
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

290
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,777
<i>If they're wise, they'll
hide behind those walls</i>

291
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,513
and chip away at us,
man by man.

292
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:53,517
I don't want half my army killed
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

293
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:56,787
We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.

294
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,491
Taking this city will not bring
you any closer to Westeros

295
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,793
or the Iron Throne.

296
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,898
How many slaves
are there in Yunkai?

297
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:10,903
200,000, if not more.

298
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:14,940
Then we have 200,000
reasons to take the city.

299
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,443
_

300
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:25,049
_

301
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,147
_

302
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,171
<i>( drum beating )</i>

303
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,434
<i>( drumming stops )</i>

304
00:21:55,706 --> 00:21:57,773
Now comes the noble
Razdal mo Eraz

305
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:01,244
of that ancient
and honorable house,

306
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,613
<i>master of men</i>
<i>and speaker to savages,</i>

307
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:07,250
- <i>to offer terms of peace.</i>
- ( dragons screech )

308
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,552
Noble lord, you are
in the presence

309
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:12,455
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

310
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:15,124
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

311
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:17,326
<i>Khaleesi</i>
<i>of the Great Grass Sea,</i>

312
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,696
<i>Breaker of Chains,</i>
<i>and Mother of Dragons.</i>

313
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:24,934
You may approach.
Sit.

314
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:36,644
Will the noble lord
take refreshment?

315
00:22:48,122 --> 00:22:51,659
Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.

316
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:53,327
Our empire was old

317
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:56,397
before dragons stirred
in old Valyria.

318
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:59,700
<i>Many an army has broken</i>
<i>against our walls.</i>

319
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:02,470
You shall find no easy
conquest here, khaleesi.

320
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:06,073
( screeching )

321
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:08,843
Good.
My Unsullied need practice.

322
00:23:08,877 --> 00:23:10,845
I was told to blood them early.

323
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:15,050
If blood is your desire,
blood shall flow.

324
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:17,820
But why?

325
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,189
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

326
00:23:21,224 --> 00:23:25,427
But the Yunkai are a forgiving
and generous people.

327
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,300
The wise masters of Yunkai
have sent a gift

328
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:32,968
for the silver queen.

329
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:43,379
There is far more than this awaiting
you on the deck of your ship.

330
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,447
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

331
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:48,284
As I said,
we are a generous people.

332
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:50,987
<i>You shall have as many
ships as you require.</i>

333
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:53,089
And what do you ask in return?

334
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:57,326
All we ask is that
you make use of these ships.

335
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:59,862
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong

336
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,765
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

337
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:08,038
I have a gift for you as well.

338
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:11,441
- Your life.
- My life?

339
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:13,176
And the lives
of your wise masters.

340
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:16,780
But I also want
something in return.

341
00:24:16,814 --> 00:24:20,384
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

342
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,487
Every man, woman, and child
shall be given as much food,

343
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:25,322
clothing, and property
as they can carry

344
00:24:25,356 --> 00:24:28,659
as payment for their
years of servitude.

345
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:30,727
Reject this gift,

346
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,129
and I shall show you no mercy.

347
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:35,165
You are mad.

348
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,000
<i>We are not Astapor or Qarth.</i>

349
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:40,236
We are Yunkai and we have
powerful friends.

350
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,007
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

351
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:47,010
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

352
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:49,379
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

353
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:51,481
( screeching )

354
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:54,150
You swore me safe conduct.

355
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:58,054
I did, but my dragons
made no promises.

356
00:24:58,088 --> 00:25:00,623
And you threatened
their mother.

357
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:02,826
Take the gold.

358
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,567
( screeching )

359
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:15,338
My gold. You gave
it to me, remember?

360
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,140
And I shall put it to good use.

361
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:20,009
You'd be wise to do the
same with my gift to you.

362
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:21,659
Now get out.

363
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:25,548
( speaking Valyrian )

364
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:28,418
The Yunkish are a proud people.

365
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:30,020
They will not bend.

366
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:33,023
And what happens to things
that don't bend?

367
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:35,092
He said he had
powerful friends.

368
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,927
Who was he talking about?

369
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:39,229
I don't know.

370
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:41,665
Find out.

371
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:47,170
( screeches )

372
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,345
( purring )

373
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:59,116
Chains?

374
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:02,387
Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.

375
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:04,590
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

376
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:07,025
Golden chains.

377
00:26:08,428 --> 00:26:10,663
You could buy
a ship with these.

378
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:12,431
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

379
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:16,269
- Am I going somewhere?
- Of course you're not going anywhere.

380
00:26:16,303 --> 00:26:20,406
So, am I invited
to your wedding?

381
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:24,877
I didn't ask for this marriage.

382
00:26:24,912 --> 00:26:27,414
- I didn't want it.
- No?

383
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:29,750
She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

384
00:26:29,784 --> 00:26:31,819
That doesn't mean that--

385
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:34,054
this is duty, not desire.

386
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:36,657
Is that what you will tell
yourself when you fuck her?

387
00:26:36,692 --> 00:26:38,793
I don't have a choice.
My father--

388
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:41,429
Does not rule the world.

389
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:47,169
We can still go
across the Narrow Sea.

390
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:49,037
What would I do there?

391
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:50,805
Juggle?

392
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,942
I am a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

393
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:56,577
And I'm Shae the funny whore.

394
00:26:56,612 --> 00:27:00,481
My feelings for you
have not changed.

395
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:03,717
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

396
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,986
While I empty her chamber pot

397
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,788
and lick your cock
when you're bored?

398
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:10,323
I swear to you
it will not be like that.

399
00:27:10,358 --> 00:27:13,159
No?
What will it be like?

400
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:18,564
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

401
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,767
You will have fine clothes,

402
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:23,570
guards to keep
you safe, servants.

403
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:28,042
Any children we might have

404
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:30,010
will be well provided for.

405
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:32,412
Children?
You think I want children

406
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,081
who can never see their father?

407
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:35,682
Who would be killed
in their sleep

408
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:38,018
if their grandfather
found out about them?

409
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:39,919
Listen.

410
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:42,221
Listen to me, my lady.

411
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:44,590
- I'm not your lady.
- You are.

412
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,860
You'll always be my lady.

413
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:54,099
I'm your whore.

414
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:57,469
And when you are tired
of fucking me,

415
00:27:57,503 --> 00:27:59,604
I will be nothing.

416
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:14,552
( seabirds calling )

417
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:32,036
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

418
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:35,206
I should have been here.

419
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:39,110
After all the running
and fighting,

420
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:42,013
here I am,
back where I started.

421
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:44,282
Do you miss it?

422
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:47,284
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

423
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,221
Never had a father.
Never wanted one.

424
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:53,824
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

425
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,626
Your talent for fighting?

426
00:28:55,661 --> 00:28:57,161
I'm lowborn.

427
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:59,430
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.

428
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:01,298
Mine was a slave.

429
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,334
So was I.

430
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,370
Bought and sold,

431
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:07,372
scourged and branded,

432
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:09,674
until the Lord of Light
reached down,

433
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,809
took me in his hand
and raised me up.

434
00:29:13,646 --> 00:29:15,213
I was born in Flea Bottom.

435
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:17,682
Your blood is noble.

436
00:29:19,151 --> 00:29:21,987
Are you saying my father,

437
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:24,523
he was some lord or...

438
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:25,824
There.

439
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:28,093
Your father's house.

440
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:36,502
I'm just a bastard.

441
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:41,808
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

442
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:44,110
First of His Name,
King of the Andals

443
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:45,912
and the First Men.

444
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:49,616
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

445
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:53,786
There is power
in a king's blood.

446
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,136
Come sit by the fire, child.

447
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:16,273
Not talking, eh?

448
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:18,476
That's a first.

449
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,844
I don't talk to traitors.

450
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,015
I didn't like
giving up the boy.

451
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,717
But you did.

452
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:29,920
You took the gold
and you gave him up.

453
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:33,957
The Red God
is the one true god.

454
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:36,426
You've seen his power.

455
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,661
When he commands, we obey.

456
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,698
He's not my one true god.

457
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:46,235
No?
Who's yours?

458
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:50,506
Death.

459
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,378
- ( men chattering )
- ( man coughing )

460
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,220
Spotted a Lannister
raiding party.

461
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:05,723
- How many?
- <i>No more than 20.</i>

462
00:31:05,758 --> 00:31:08,393
- How far?
- Less than a day's ride south.

463
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:13,999
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

464
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,069
Men:
Yeah!

465
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:19,239
But what about Riverrun?

466
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:21,107
It's not south.
It's west of here.

467
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:23,343
It will still be west of here
two days from now.

468
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:26,513
- You swore.
- To take you home, and I will.

469
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:28,715
But we need to do this first.

470
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:30,617
Why? So you can
steal their gold?

471
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:32,185
I swear to you,
this isn't--

472
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,855
I don't care what you swear
because you're a liar.

473
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:36,523
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

474
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:39,927
You'll lie to anyone. I hope
the Lannisters kill you all.

475
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:42,997
One day you'll understand,
but now--

476
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:48,536
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Man: Come back, girl!

477
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:13,127
( gasps )

478
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:14,828
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

479
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:17,331
Won't do you no good.

480
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:25,839
<i>( door opens )</i>

481
00:32:34,448 --> 00:32:36,516
I thought you were gone.

482
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,685
Tomorrow.

483
00:32:42,022 --> 00:32:45,024
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

484
00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:49,595
Lord Bolton's traveling
tomorrow as well.

485
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:52,765
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

486
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,201
You're to remain here.

487
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:57,704
With Locke?

488
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:06,681
I owe you a debt.

489
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,486
When Catelyn Stark
released you,

490
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,223
we both made a promise to her.

491
00:33:15,257 --> 00:33:17,224
<i>Now it's your promise.</i>

492
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:19,960
You gave your word.

493
00:33:19,994 --> 00:33:21,561
Keep it

494
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:24,564
and consider the debt paid.

495
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,634
I will return the Stark
girls to their mother.

496
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,904
I swear it.

497
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:39,879
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

498
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,067
( grunting )

499
00:33:59,101 --> 00:34:02,037
Here.
Let me.

500
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,347
It will take time.

501
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:19,121
Qyburn hopes your father
will force the Citadel

502
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:20,890
<i>to give him back his chain.</i>

503
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,792
My father will make
him Grand Maester

504
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:25,294
if he grows me a new hand.

505
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:29,232
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

506
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:34,304
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I
couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

507
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,507
The Lannisters send
their regards.

508
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,782
Safe journey, Kingslayer.

509
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:47,085
Nothing to say?

510
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,521
I liked you better before.

511
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:52,857
I don't remember chopping
your balls off, too.

512
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,793
And don't you worry
about your friend.

513
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,963
We'll take good care of her.

514
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,449
Shh.

515
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:21,518
( Theon groaning )

516
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:44,640
Gentle, my lord.

517
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:46,875
- ( gasping )
- Gentle.

518
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:58,454
- ( Theon coughs )
- Shh shh shh.

519
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:01,157
Myranda knows what she's doing.

520
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:02,859
Let her.

521
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,162
She trained as a septa, only...

522
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,730
( giggles )

523
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,466
she had other urges.

524
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,337
So did the septons,
only they lied about it.

525
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,407
Where is he?

526
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,941
Who, my lord?

527
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,512
There's no one here
but you, me, and Violet.

528
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:25,114
Please.

529
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,350
Don't you want us to see it?

530
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,419
Oh, come on.
Let us see it.

531
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,688
Everybody talks about it.

532
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,725
He sent you.

533
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,259
Who sent us?

534
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,362
We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy.

535
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,331
We heard so much about it.

536
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,433
( giggles )

537
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,669
- Please.
- Oh!

538
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,239
There it is.

539
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,976
Oh.

540
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,679
Do you think we're ugly?

541
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,747
He thinks we're ugly.

542
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:57,683
Well, he's been
through so much.

543
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:00,119
Look at his poor face.

544
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:03,122
Help me.

545
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:06,625
If he comes back...

546
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:11,464
We need to make him
feel better.

547
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:14,467
And how can we make
him feel better?

548
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:17,203
I have an idea.

549
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:40,360
Oh, she's shy.

550
00:37:40,395 --> 00:37:44,397
You know how they are,
these religious girls.

551
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,601
Maybe he doesn't
know how we are.

552
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,214
Oh.

553
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:04,183
I felt something.

554
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:10,323
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

555
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:15,295
- As good as they say?
- Mmm.

556
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:18,665
( breathing heavily )

557
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:27,340
And why should you
get all the fun?

558
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:40,520
What?
You like her better?

559
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:46,360
Plenty there for both of us.

560
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,564
I was here first.

561
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:53,033
( moaning )

562
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:56,703
<i>( horn blows )</i>

563
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:01,006
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

564
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,108
Terrible timing.

565
00:39:03,143 --> 00:39:05,277
( crying )

566
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:08,813
But I was getting jealous.

567
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,519
Well?

568
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:18,090
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

569
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:24,496
( groans )

570
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:33,139
Everyone knows you love girls.

571
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:37,110
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

572
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:49,725
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

573
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:53,729
Would you say it's
your most precious part?

574
00:39:56,833 --> 00:40:00,069
- ( whistles )
- Please.

575
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:03,038
( sobbing )
No.

576
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:05,141
<i>No!</i>
<i>Mercy, please!</i>

577
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:07,143
<i>Please, mercy!</i>
<i>Mercy!</i>

578
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:09,946
This is mercy.

579
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,181
I'm not killing you.

580
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:16,286
<i>Just making a few alterations.</i>

581
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,891
No! No! No!

582
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,727
Please, no! No!

583
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:26,130
No! No, please!
Please!

584
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:30,367
You're gonna scare it off.

585
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:33,270
I'm not gonna scare it.
I'm gonna kill it.

586
00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:36,673
It's too far away.

587
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:01,763
Is that a palace?

588
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:06,234
It's a windmill.

589
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:09,004
Windmill.

590
00:41:09,038 --> 00:41:12,541
Who built it?
Some king?

591
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:14,910
Just the men
who used to live here.

592
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:16,545
Ygritte: <i>They must have
been great builders,</i>

593
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,814
<i>stacking stones so high.</i>

594
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,917
Winterfell has towers
three times that size.

595
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:24,853
( mocking ) "I'm Jon Snow
and I'm from Winterfell.

596
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:26,054
My daddy was a fancy lord

597
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:29,024
and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."

598
00:41:29,058 --> 00:41:31,027
If you're impressed
by a windmill,

599
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:34,030
you'd be swooning if you saw
the Great Keep at Winterfell.

600
00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:35,899
What's swooning?

601
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:37,734
Fainting.

602
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:40,303
What's fainting?

603
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:45,175
When a girl sees blood
and collapses.

604
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,378
Why would a girl
see blood and collapse?

605
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:50,247
Well...

606
00:41:50,282 --> 00:41:52,482
not all girls are like you.

607
00:41:53,651 --> 00:41:55,686
Well, girls see
more blood than boys.

608
00:41:56,888 --> 00:41:59,789
Or do you like girls
who swoon, Jon Snow?

609
00:41:59,824 --> 00:42:01,557
( gasps )
Oh, a spider!

610
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:04,126
Save me, Jon Snow.

611
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:06,462
My dress is made
of the purest silk

612
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:08,864
from Tralalalaleeday.

613
00:42:08,898 --> 00:42:11,466
I'd like to see you
in a silk dress.

614
00:42:13,603 --> 00:42:16,104
Would you?

615
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:21,110
So I could tear it off you.

616
00:42:21,144 --> 00:42:24,079
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress,

617
00:42:24,113 --> 00:42:26,248
I'll blacken your eye.

618
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:36,024
Maybe one day I'll take
you to Winterfell.

619
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,995
Or maybe one day
I'll take you there.

620
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:42,330
After we've taken
our land back.

621
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:47,135
Ygritte.

622
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:52,375
You won't win.

623
00:42:53,911 --> 00:42:56,212
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

624
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:59,449
- You know nothing--
- Six times in the last thousand years,

625
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:01,752
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

626
00:43:01,786 --> 00:43:05,423
- Six times they failed.
- And how do you know that?

627
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,358
Every boy in the North
knows it.

628
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:08,827
We grow up learning it.

629
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:10,228
Where the battles were fought,

630
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:11,996
the names of the heroes,
who died where.

631
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,898
Six times you've invaded

632
00:43:13,932 --> 00:43:17,101
and six times you've failed.

633
00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:19,136
The seventh will be the same.

634
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,372
- Mance is different.
- You don't have the discipline.

635
00:43:22,406 --> 00:43:25,975
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

636
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,410
You don't know
how to fight together.

637
00:43:27,444 --> 00:43:29,946
- You don't know that.
- I do.

638
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,747
I know it.

639
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:34,116
If you attack the Wall,
you'll die.

640
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,051
All of you.

641
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:46,328
All of <i>us.</i>

642
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:04,280
You're mine

643
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:06,849
as I'm yours.

644
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:09,418
And if we die, we die.

645
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:12,922
But first we'll live.

646
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:16,926
Yes, first we'll live.

647
00:44:28,538 --> 00:44:31,641
( Jojen speaking quietly )

648
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:36,045
What's he going on about?

649
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,448
And how come he always
gets to sit and chat

650
00:44:38,482 --> 00:44:40,550
while we do all the work?

651
00:44:43,487 --> 00:44:45,122
Hodor.

652
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:50,328
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

653
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:52,063
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

654
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:54,064
You think I can't
hear you every day?

655
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,733
Filling his head
with black magic.

656
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:58,769
<i>Talking about visions and
three-eyed ravens and worse.</i>

657
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:01,639
- Leave him alone.
- He can speak for himself.

658
00:45:01,674 --> 00:45:03,374
I don't fill his head
with anything.

659
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:05,943
Osha: <i>So what do you talk about?</i>

660
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:09,079
What's happening to him
and what that means.

661
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:11,681
Go on, then.
Tell us what it means.

662
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:13,283
It's not like that.

663
00:45:13,317 --> 00:45:15,084
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>tell him all the answers.</i>

664
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,487
<i>It would be much easier.</i>

665
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:20,289
I don't want you
talking to him anymore.

666
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:21,791
Until we get to your brother
at Castle Black.

667
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:24,760
- We're not going to Castle Black.
- What did you say?

668
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:28,296
I told you already.
Jon Snow isn't there.

669
00:45:28,331 --> 00:45:30,031
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

670
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:31,700
Oh, no.
I'm not going back there.

671
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:34,803
Your brother is at Castle Black.
That's where we're going.

672
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,340
Look at me.

673
00:45:39,675 --> 00:45:41,643
The raven's been coming to me

674
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:44,046
ever since I fell
from that tower.

675
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,849
He wants me to find him.

676
00:45:46,883 --> 00:45:50,252
I don't have my legs anymore.

677
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:52,188
This is what I have now.

678
00:45:52,222 --> 00:45:54,390
You have a family.

679
00:45:54,424 --> 00:45:56,258
You need to go back
to Castle Black

680
00:45:56,293 --> 00:45:59,061
so you can get back to
them where you belong.

681
00:45:59,096 --> 00:46:02,065
What if I belong in the North?

682
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,402
What if I fell from
that tower for a reason?

683
00:46:06,436 --> 00:46:08,638
Is that what he's telling you?

684
00:46:08,672 --> 00:46:10,840
That it's all for a reason?

685
00:46:10,874 --> 00:46:15,078
All these bad things happened because
the gods got big plans for you?

686
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:17,080
I wish it were true,
little lord.

687
00:46:17,115 --> 00:46:21,285
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.

688
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,587
You don't understand.
You don't know.

689
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:25,589
You don't know.
None of you know.

690
00:46:25,623 --> 00:46:27,858
None of you have been up there.

691
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:33,296
I had a man once.

692
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,065
A good man.

693
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,867
Bruni, his name was.

694
00:46:36,902 --> 00:46:39,904
I was his and he was mine.

695
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:42,906
But one night Bruni disappears.

696
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:45,542
People said he left me,

697
00:46:45,576 --> 00:46:46,910
but I knew him.

698
00:46:46,944 --> 00:46:50,880
<i>He'd never leave me.</i>
<i>Not for long.</i>

699
00:46:50,914 --> 00:46:53,283
I knew he'd come back.

700
00:46:54,952 --> 00:46:57,053
And he did.

701
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:01,458
<i>He came in through</i>
<i>the back of the hut.</i>

702
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:04,295
Only it wasn't Bruni.

703
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:06,897
Not really.

704
00:47:06,932 --> 00:47:10,468
His skin was pale

705
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:13,871
like a dead man's.

706
00:47:13,906 --> 00:47:16,741
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

707
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,248
<i>He came at me,</i>

708
00:47:22,282 --> 00:47:24,250
grabbed me by the neck

709
00:47:24,284 --> 00:47:27,120
and squeezed so hard

710
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:29,990
I could feel the life
slipping out of me.

711
00:47:32,293 --> 00:47:34,728
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how I got the knife.</i>

712
00:47:34,762 --> 00:47:37,665
<i>When I did, I stuck it</i>

713
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:40,401
deep into his heart.

714
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:46,340
And he hardly seemed to notice.

715
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:52,046
<i>I had to burn our hut down</i>
<i>with him inside.</i>

716
00:47:54,449 --> 00:47:57,184
I didn't ask the gods
what it meant.

717
00:47:57,218 --> 00:48:00,954
I didn't need to.
I already knew.

718
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:04,157
<i>It meant the North</i>
<i>was no place for men to be.</i>

719
00:48:04,192 --> 00:48:06,460
<i>Not anymore.</i>

720
00:48:08,797 --> 00:48:11,032
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black

721
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:13,634
and no further.

722
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:23,777
Qyburn: How is the
pain, my lord?

723
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,882
What's the purpose
of an arm with no hand?

724
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:36,421
Well, we've stymied
the corruption.

725
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:39,258
Yes, we've stymied
the corruption.

726
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,360
You're a learned man.

727
00:48:41,394 --> 00:48:42,995
All the good it's done me.

728
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:45,197
You did well
sewing up this mess.

729
00:48:45,231 --> 00:48:47,566
You're far better
at this sort of work

730
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:50,269
than Grand Maester Pycelle.

731
00:48:50,304 --> 00:48:52,905
Faint praise, my lord.

732
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:57,744
So why did the Citadel
take your chain?

733
00:48:57,778 --> 00:48:59,745
Did you fondle
one boy too many?

734
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,049
No, my lord.
That's not my weakness.

735
00:49:04,518 --> 00:49:06,819
What is?

736
00:49:09,089 --> 00:49:10,623
Curiosity.

737
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:14,627
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

738
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:16,929
And the only way
to understand it

739
00:49:16,964 --> 00:49:19,332
is to study the afflicted.

740
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:22,035
You performed experiments
on living men.

741
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,937
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

742
00:49:23,972 --> 00:49:27,008
My studies
have given me insight

743
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:28,710
that has saved many lives.

744
00:49:28,744 --> 00:49:31,112
Dying paupers, I assume.

745
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:34,715
Men with no families
to complain.

746
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,551
You found them moaning
in the poorhouse

747
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:39,020
and had them carted
back to your garret

748
00:49:39,054 --> 00:49:42,323
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

749
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:44,792
How many men have
you killed, my lord?

750
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:46,461
I don't know.

751
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,631
50? 100?

752
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:53,469
Countless.

753
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:55,505
Countless has
a nice ring to it.

754
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:57,841
And how many lives
have you saved?

755
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,710
Half a million.

756
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:04,147
The population
of King's Landing.

757
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:12,756
You were in charge
of the ravens at Harrenhal.

758
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,993
Did you-- did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?

759
00:50:17,028 --> 00:50:19,629
A bird flew off
and a bird flew back.

760
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:23,232
Lord Selwyn Tarth

761
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:26,969
offered 300 gold dragons for
his daughter's safe return.

762
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:30,840
- A fair offer.
- A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

763
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,411
Why not?

764
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:35,812
He's convinced Lord Tarth

765
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:38,548
owns all the sapphire
mines in Westeros.

766
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:39,950
( sighs )

767
00:50:39,984 --> 00:50:42,286
He feels he's being cheated.

768
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,489
They'd be fools to kill her.

769
00:50:44,523 --> 00:50:46,958
These men have been
at war a long time.

770
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:49,160
Most of them
will be dead by winter.

771
00:50:49,195 --> 00:50:52,130
She'll be their
entertainment tonight.

772
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:54,399
Beyond tonight,

773
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:56,701
I don't think
they care very much.

774
00:51:15,854 --> 00:51:18,256
We have to return to Harrenhal.

775
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,723
Why?

776
00:51:19,758 --> 00:51:21,225
I've left something behind.

777
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:22,860
Absolutely not.

778
00:51:22,894 --> 00:51:24,862
I've got orders
from Lord Bolton.

779
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:26,430
And what are those orders?

780
00:51:26,464 --> 00:51:29,967
To deliver you to your
father at King's Landing.

781
00:51:30,001 --> 00:51:32,236
You think you'll get a reward.

782
00:51:34,272 --> 00:51:37,040
I serve Lord Bolton.

783
00:51:37,074 --> 00:51:38,608
Any appreciation
your father--

784
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:39,976
You think
you're getting a reward.

785
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,310
Let me explain
something to you.

786
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:43,345
When my father sees me,
the first thing

787
00:51:43,379 --> 00:51:45,747
he's going to ask
is what happened to my hand.

788
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:49,017
And I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

789
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:52,887
- I had nothing--
- Or I could tell him this man saved my life.

790
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:57,159
We return to Harrenhal now.

791
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:16,444
( birds cawing )

792
00:52:16,479 --> 00:52:18,713
Whoa.

793
00:52:20,216 --> 00:52:22,618
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

794
00:52:22,652 --> 00:52:25,821
<i>( distant men singing )</i>

795
00:52:27,257 --> 00:52:30,827

( cheering )

801
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,409
Man:
<i>Don't spare her.</i>

802
00:52:46,444 --> 00:52:48,978
<i>Don't spare her!</i>

803
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:50,646
( roaring )

804
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:54,250
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

805
00:52:54,285 --> 00:52:55,918
Stop running and fight.

806
00:52:55,952 --> 00:52:57,887
<i>( bear growling )</i>

807
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,995
A wooden sword?

808
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,832
- I thought you'd gone.
- You gave her a wooden sword.

809
00:53:07,866 --> 00:53:09,634
We've only got one bear.

810
00:53:09,668 --> 00:53:11,302
I'll pay her bloody ransom.

811
00:53:11,336 --> 00:53:13,304
Gold, sapphires,
whatever you want.

812
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:14,939
Just get her out of there.

813
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:17,341
All you lords and ladies

814
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:20,277
still think that the only
thing that matters is gold.

815
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:23,714
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

816
00:53:23,748 --> 00:53:26,817
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

817
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,253
So go buy yourself
a golden hand

818
00:53:29,287 --> 00:53:31,922
and fuck yourself with it.

819
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:36,293
( roaring )

820
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,468
Ah!

821
00:53:50,808 --> 00:53:52,342
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

822
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:53,977
( groans )

823
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:03,218
( growls )

824
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:05,688
What the fuck are you
doing to my bear?

825
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:07,623
Lord Bolton charged me
with bringing him back

826
00:54:07,657 --> 00:54:10,692
to King's Landing alive
and that's what I aim to do.

827
00:54:14,196 --> 00:54:16,130
Pull her up.

828
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,244
Hold my legs.

829
00:54:38,953 --> 00:54:41,421
( roaring )

830
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,701
Pull him up!

831
00:54:58,805 --> 00:55:00,906
( men booing )

832
00:55:05,979 --> 00:55:08,114
The bitch stays.

833
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,618
We're taking her
to King's Landing.

834
00:55:12,652 --> 00:55:14,286
Unless you kill me.

835
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,524
She belongs to me.

836
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:21,460
Lord Bolton's orders.

837
00:55:21,494 --> 00:55:24,263
What do you think is more
important to Lord Bolton?

838
00:55:24,297 --> 00:55:25,998
Getting his pet rat a reward

839
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:29,368
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

840
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:46,253
<i>( bear roaring )</i>

841
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:52,660
Well, we must be on our way.

842
00:55:56,198 --> 00:55:58,366
Sorry about the sapphires.
